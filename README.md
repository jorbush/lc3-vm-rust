# LC-3 Virtual Machine in Rust

This project is an implementation of the LC-3 Virtual Machine (VM) in Rust, inspired by [the tutorial by James Meiners](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/). The LC-3 is a simple educational computer designed to teach the basics of computer architecture and machine language programming.
